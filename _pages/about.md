Iâ€™m an business data analyst, experienced with Python and R programming as well as data visualizations in PowerBI and Tableau. I specialize in machine learning techniques, and data wrangling. I have a master's level education in Business Analytics as well as ample work and recreational experience on various projects. I am passionate about making connections, solving complex problems, and creating compelling analytical insights. I consistently enjoy taking on new and intricate data problems to solve.  I also enjoy strategy video games, building custom PCs, running,  and DIY projects in my free time. I love working on projects together, so feel free to reach out for collaboration!
